.I have designed weather-app in which you can easily see the weather of differrent location in the world. 
I have used third party Api for weather data and technology used is nodejs, expressjs and for front end it is all about javascript and handlebars (hbs)

If you want to run this project :
1) You have to create account on  OpenWeatherMap website, copy the key and paste the key into the api url on the place my key, link is: https://openweathermap.org/api
2) You have to run npm init command also for package.json file because all the modules of nodejs present in it.
